# `zanicc` R package

The zanicc R package implements Bayesian models for zero- and $N$-inflated count-compositional data.
Its main contribution is an implementation of the models introduced in

The `zanicc` R package implements the novel models proposed in the paper
"Bayesian nonparametric models for zero-inflated
count-compositional data using ensembles of regression trees"
by André F. B. Menezes, Andrew C. Parnell, and Keefe Murphy, along with other 
related models from the literature such as the multinomial-BART and the ZANIDM regression models.

You can install the development version of `zanicc` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("AndrMenezes/zanicc")
```

The script located at `inst/toy_example.R` reproduces the simulation study presented
in Section 3.1 of the main paper.
