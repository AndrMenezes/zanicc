\title{Read binary data related to the draws of \eqn{\theta} and \eqn{\zeta}.}
\usage{
.load_bin(fname, n, d, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{fname}{file name along with the path.}

\item{n}{number of sample size.}

\item{d}{number of categories/columns of the Y vector.}

\item{m}{number of iterations to read, i.e., the batch size.}

\item{k}{first iteration to read.}
}
\description{
Binary data is exported during the MCMC of ZANIM-BART. This function
read it in memory and format as an array. The \code{.load_bin} read all first \eqn{m},
while the \code{.load_bin_batch} read from the \eqn{k}-th to the \eqn{m}-th iteration.
